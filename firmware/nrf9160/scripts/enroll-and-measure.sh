# Teach the pendant a word, then measure how well it tells that word from
# everything else. Steps 4-7 of the local-command verification.
#
# This needs a HUMAN VOICE and cannot be automated. `say` produces byte-identical
# audio on every run, so enrolling and testing with it would score ~0 every time
# and prove nothing — it would reproduce exactly the synthetic-template problem
# this measurement exists to replace. Your natural repeats vary; that variation
# IS the measurement.
#
#   ./enroll-and-measure.sh enroll 1 "banana"     # teach slot 1
#   ./enroll-and-measure.sh test   "banana"       # one scored press
#   ./enroll-and-measure.sh table  "banana" 10    # repeat and tabulate
#
# Addresses are re-derived from the ELF every run. They MOVE between builds —
# scripts/be-the-user.sh has a hardcoded one that is already stale.

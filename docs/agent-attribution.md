# Who wrote what, 2026-08-08 → 09

Git cannot answer this. Every commit in this repository shares one author
(`Evan Liu <evan20050827@gmail.com>`), and the `Co-Authored-By` trailers name
*models* — "Claude Opus 5", "Claude Fable 5" — not the agents that did the work.
Agent identity has only ever lived in commit-message prose, and at least one
`git commit` without a pathspec swept another agent's uncommitted files into an
unrelated commit, taking that prose with it.

`git log --all -- browser-extension/src/relay-peer.js` returns exactly one
commit, under the wrong author's message. That file has no other history.

**This document exists because the mapping was recoverable from exactly one
place — the coordinating session's working memory — and that expires.** Two
agents independently established that it is not in git, not in the transcript
store, and not mechanically derivable: no test can distinguish "history erased
by a sweep" from "legitimately written in one broad commit", because the
distinguishing information was never recorded anywhere queryable.

Confidence is marked per row. **Spawned** means the coordinator created that
agent with that brief and holds the assignment directly. **Reported** means the
agent said so in its own completion report. **Inferred** means neither — treat
it as a lead, not a fact.

## Known mis-attributions

Recorded so nobody "corrects" them into something worse. In every case the
content is intact and tested; only the authorship line is wrong.

- **`6351fbd`** (mesh-sockets) swept 16 files, including all of
  `extension-relay`'s `relay-peer.js` work. This is the destructive one — it is
  the *only* commit touching that file.
- **`376812b`** (coordinator) committed mesh-sockets' in-flight
  `nodeInference.js` work under a coordinator message. Deliberate, with a
  correct pathspec — which is the point worth keeping: **a pathspec stops you
  taking work by accident and does nothing about taking it on purpose.**
- **`be5a555`, `5ddce9b`** (multi-origin) swept other agents' derivation
  artifacts under multi-origin messages. Regenerable, so cheap.

## The rule that prevents the next one

`git add <path>` is **not** sufficient. `git commit` with no pathspec commits
the whole index, which is shared state when several agents are working at once —
an agent that stages only its own files can still commit eleven of someone
else's. Use:

    git commit -- <paths>

For agents that mutate overlapping files, prefer worktree isolation so there is
no shared index to sweep at all.

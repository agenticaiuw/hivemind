 * Derived secrets: PAIRING_CODE is the one owner-minted secret.
 *
 * The .env used to carry three independent random values that all proved the
 * same thing — "this is the owner's machine": PAIRING_CODE, AGENT_TOKEN and
 * SESSION_SECRET. Three values in ONE file is not three secrets; whoever
 * reads the file has all of them, so the extra two bought no isolation, only
 * bookkeeping. The owner's verdict (2026-08-09): "we must reduce the number
 * of env variables as much as possible."
 *
 * So the other two are now derived from PAIRING_CODE with labelled HMACs.
 * Deterministic and stateless: every process that can read the code computes
 * the same tokens, nothing new is stored, and rotating the code rotates
 * everything below it in one edit.
 *
 * Precedence is applyParsedEnv's, unchanged: an explicit AGENT_TOKEN or
 * SESSION_SECRET in the environment or the file still wins, which is both
 * the migration path and the escape hatch (the Mac menubar HUD, if it holds
 * the old token value somewhere of its own, is fixed by putting the old
 * AGENT_TOKEN line back).
 *
 * Going through applyParsedEnv rather than assigning process.env directly is
 * load-bearing: it records the keys, and childEnv.js strips recorded keys
 * from every child the agent spawns. A derived credential that skipped the
 * record would ride into run_shell children — the exact leak childEnv
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * The same derivation exists in software/load-pendant-env.mjs for scripts
 * and the dashboards. Duplicated, not imported — the loaders belong to
 * different packages and each must work with the other absent — and
 * loadEnv.test.js asserts the two stay bit-identical.

/*
 * The extension's SECOND peer: the relay, reached directly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN
 *
 * Every relay→extension hop went through the Mac at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
 * bridge-core.js refused any other host, and manifest.json granted no other
 * origin, so the relay — the one body that is awake by construction — could
 * not tell this extension anything at all once the lid closed. This module is
 * the other half of the node mesh (shared/nodeMesh.js) seen from inside a
 * browser: drain my own inbox, act on what is addressed to me, answer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DOORBELL, AND THE POLLER UNDER IT
 *
 * This module first shipped as a poller, because /v1/node/socket authenticated
 * only from an `Authorization` header and a service worker's WebSocket
 * constructor cannot send one. That was a relay bug, not a platform limit, and
 * it has been fixed (cloudflare-worker/bridgeHub.js, commit 9408983): the
 * credential may now ride as a second subprotocol offer. Measured against
 * production on 2026-08-09, with a browser_node credential:
 *
 *   Authorization header only                    -> 101
 *   no credential at all                         -> 401
 *   subprotocol only, no Authorization           -> 101, server selects
 *                                                   "pendant.mesh.v1"
 *   subprotocol + someone else's deviceId        -> 403
 *   bearer.<token> offered alone                 -> 101, and NO
 *                                                   Sec-WebSocket-Protocol in
 *                                                   the response at all
 *
 * The last two are the ones worth keeping: principalOwnsDevice still runs, so
 * this is not a weaker door, and the token is never reflected into a response
 * header even when it is the only offer. End to end, a socket opened this way
 * received {"type":"pong"} to its ping and {"type":"mail"} when the relay
 * brain posted a message — which arrived `pushed:true queued:false` rather
 * than the `pushed:false queued:true` the poller-only build always saw.
 *
 * SO WHY IS THERE STILL A POLLER. Because the socket cannot be the only way
 * in, for reasons that are all about this runtime rather than about the relay:
 *
 *   1. Safari suspends MV3 service workers. Mail that arrives while the worker
 *      is dead rings a doorbell nobody hears, so every wake MUST drain once
 *      regardless of socket state. That is the fallback-on-wake path.
 *   2. A frame is not durable. The D1 row is. A dropped frame or a reconnect
 *      that lands between the ring and the listener costs nothing only if
 *      something eventually sweeps.
 *   3. A credential can stop working under a live socket. Observed while
 *      writing this: a token that had just handshaked began returning 401 on
 *      every route, because DELETE /v1/devices/:deviceId had retired the
 *      device out from under it — that route drops the device row, its
 *      credentials and its undrained mail together, so retiring a device
 *      another process is authenticating as revokes it mid-flight. The socket
 *      closes; the node must notice and say so rather than go quiet.
 *
 * So: the socket is primary and the poller is a safety sweep whose interval
 * stretches to RELAY_POLL_SOCKET_MS while a socket is actually up, and snaps
 * back to the active cadence the moment it is not. choosePeer() below is where
 * that is decided, and it is a pure function so the decision is assertable.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PEERS, NOT A NEW SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE
 *
 * The Mac path is untouched. choosePeer() below is the whole policy, written
 * as a pure function so it can be asserted rather than inferred from timing:
 * listen on BOTH peers whenever both are configured, prefer the Mac for
 * outbound because it is a loopback round trip, and poll the relay harder the
 * moment the Mac stops answering. Listening on both is not redundancy for its
 * own sake — mesh mail is durable, so a relay message sent while the Mac is
 * healthy must still be read, or "two reachable peers" is a slogan.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS PURE. No fetch, no storage, no browser APIs. The impure
 * edges live in background.js and are injected, the same split brain.js uses.

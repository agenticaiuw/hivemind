/*
 * The extension's SECOND peer: the relay, reached directly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN
 *
 * Every relay→extension hop went through the Mac at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
 * bridge-core.js refused any other host, and manifest.json granted no other
 * origin, so the relay — the one body that is awake by construction — could
 * not tell this extension anything at all once the lid closed. This module is
 * the other half of the node mesh (shared/nodeMesh.js) seen from inside a
 * browser: drain my own inbox, act on what is addressed to me, answer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS A POLLER AND NOT A SOCKET
 *
 * The mesh was designed around a doorbell: GET /v1/node/socket, one frame
 * {"type":"mail"}, drain immediately. A browser cannot open it. Verified
 * against the live relay on 2026-08-09:
 *
 *   Upgrade + Authorization: Bearer <device token>  -> 101 Switching Protocols
 *   Upgrade, no Authorization header                -> 401
 *   Upgrade + Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer.<tok>  -> 401
 *
 * The WebSocket constructor available to a service worker cannot set request
 * headers; its only extension point is the subprotocol argument, and
 * cloudflare-worker/bridgeHub.js handleHubUpgrade reads Authorization and
 * nothing else. So the doorbell is closed to this node until the relay learns
 * to accept a credential a browser can actually send. Until then the durable
 * half of the mesh — the D1 queue behind GET /v1/node/inbox — is reachable
 * over ordinary authenticated HTTPS and delivers every message, just later.
 *
 * The property the owner asked for survives: relay → extension with the Mac
 * asleep. What is lost is latency, and only latency: a poll interval instead
 * of one round trip. That trade is stated here rather than hidden in a comment
 * about "eventual" delivery, because it is the one thing a reader of this file
 * should not have to discover by measuring.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PEERS, NOT A NEW SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE
 *
 * The Mac path is untouched. choosePeer() below is the whole policy, written
 * as a pure function so it can be asserted rather than inferred from timing:
 * listen on BOTH peers whenever both are configured, prefer the Mac for
 * outbound because it is a loopback round trip, and poll the relay harder the
 * moment the Mac stops answering. Listening on both is not redundancy for its
 * own sake — mesh mail is durable, so a relay message sent while the Mac is
 * healthy must still be read, or "two reachable peers" is a slogan.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS PURE. No fetch, no storage, no browser APIs. The impure
 * edges live in background.js and are injected, the same split brain.js uses.
